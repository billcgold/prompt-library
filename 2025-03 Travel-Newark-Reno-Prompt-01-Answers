Dual-Access Connectivity: U.S. Cities with Direct Flights to Newark (EWR) and Reno (RNO) in MarchI. Executive Summary: Cities Offering Dual Direct Access to Newark (EWR) and Reno (RNO) in MarchThis report identifies United States cities that provide direct, non-stop flight services to both Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), with its IATA code confirmed in documents 1, and Reno-Tahoe International Airport (RNO), IATA code RNO 2, specifically for the month of March. Based on an analysis of March 2025 flight schedules for Reno and generally operational route data for Newark, a select list of cities has been compiled.The findings indicate that while Newark serves as a major East Coast international gateway with an extensive network of 190 non-stop destinations 3, and Reno functions as a key regional airport with a more concentrated network of approximately 23 direct routes 4, the number of U.S. cities offering direct passage to both is limited. This focused connectivity primarily originates from major national airline hubs and significant population centers demonstrating substantial bi-coastal travel demand. The cities identified are: Atlanta (ATL), Austin (AUS), Chicago O'Hare (ORD), Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Denver (DEN), Houston-Intercontinental (IAH), Las Vegas (LAS), Los Angeles (LAX), Minneapolis (MSP), Phoenix (PHX), Salt Lake City (SLC), San Diego (SAN), San Francisco (SFO), San Jose (SJC), and Seattle (SEA).It is imperative to note that while the flight information for Reno (RNO) is based on confirmed March 2025 schedules 5, the data for Newark (EWR) connections largely reflects generally available direct routes. Airline schedules are subject to change. Therefore, travelers are strongly advised to perform final verification of all flight details, particularly for Newark (EWR) services, closer to their intended March travel dates. The limited overlap in direct service to both airports underscores the niche nature of this dual connectivity, highlighting the strategic importance of these common departure points for airlines and travelers alike.II. Methodology: Identifying Qualifying Cities for March TravelThe identification of U.S. cities offering direct flights to both Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) and Reno-Tahoe International Airport (RNO) for March travel involved a multi-step process, prioritizing the most current and specific data available for the requested timeframe.Data Sources for Reno (RNO) – March Operations:The primary and most critical source for determining direct flight connectivity to Reno (RNO) in March was the official "UPDATE – March Flight Schedule" released by the Reno-Tahoe International Airport.5 This document provided detailed information on airlines serving RNO, their flight frequencies (e.g., "1 Daily Flight," "6-10 Daily Flights"), and crucial operational notes specific to March. These notes included service commencement dates for new routes, such as Southwest Airlines' service from Austin (AUS) starting March 6th, and Frontier Airlines' services from Denver (DEN) and Las Vegas (LAS) beginning March 7th. It also indicated service cessations, for example, Spirit Airlines' route from Los Angeles (LAX) to RNO ending on March 3rd.5 This airport-level data was supplemented by airline-specific announcements and schedules where available, such as confirmations of Delta Air Lines' direct Atlanta (ATL) to RNO flights in March 6 and details surrounding Southwest's new Austin (AUS) to RNO service.7Data Sources for Newark (EWR) – General Operations & March Indicators:To establish a baseline of cities with direct flight services to Newark (EWR), comprehensive flight aggregation platforms such as flightsfrom.com 9 and directflights.com 3 were utilized. These platforms typically list non-stop destinations and often provide general flight frequencies; for instance, flightsfrom.com indicates "18-21 flights per day" for the Chicago O'Hare (ORD) to EWR route.9 This information was then cross-referenced with Google Flights data extracted from various sources.10 While Google Flights data often reflects current or near-term availability, statements such as "Nonstop flights: Every day," found for numerous EWR routes 10, offer a strong indication of regular, ongoing service, which is assumed to extend into March unless specific contradictory information is available.Cross-Referencing and Verification Process:The process involved compiling a definitive list of U.S. cities with direct flights to RNO specifically for March, noting the operating airlines and their March-specific frequencies as detailed in the RNO airport schedule.5 Concurrently, a comprehensive list of U.S. cities with generally confirmed direct flights to EWR was assembled from the aggregator sites and Google Flights data. These two lists were then meticulously compared to identify the common U.S. cities. International destinations, such as Guadalajara (GDL) which has direct flights to RNO in March 5, were excluded from the final list as per the query's focus on U.S. cities.Caveat Regarding EWR March Data Precision:It is crucial to emphasize that while the data for RNO connections is highly specific to March 2025, the information for EWR routes largely reflects established, generally operational services. Airline schedules are inherently dynamic and can be altered due to various factors.13 Consequently, travelers must verify EWR flight availability, schedules, and operating airlines for their specific March travel dates directly with the respective airlines or through reliable real-time booking platforms.The application of a "March" filter, particularly through the official RNO schedule, provides valuable insights into seasonal adjustments and airline market confidence for the Reno-Tahoe area. The RNO March schedule is not a static annual list; it reveals services commencing (e.g., Southwest AUS-RNO, Frontier DEN-RNO) and ceasing (e.g., Spirit LAX-RNO) within or at the beginning of the month.5 Airlines meticulously plan these schedules based on projected demand, aircraft deployment, and competitive landscapes. March, often a shoulder season, can witness airlines either preparing for spring/summer leisure travel or maintaining essential business and hub connectivity. The routes operational to RNO in March, and especially any new services starting, reflect the airlines' confidence in passenger demand for this period. This March-specific data for RNO, therefore, offers a more nuanced understanding of its accessibility compared to a generic annual overview, providing a higher degree of certainty for initial travel planning to Reno.III. Verified Direct Flight Network to Reno (RNO) – MarchThis section details the U.S. cities confirmed to have direct, non-stop flight services to Reno-Tahoe International Airport (RNO) for the month of March.

IV. Key Direct Flight Network to Newark (EWR)This section focuses on the U.S. cities that maintain generally confirmed direct flight connections to Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) and also feature in the March direct flight network for Reno (RNO), as detailed in the preceding section. This approach allows for the identification of common points of origin for travelers seeking access to both destinations.The primary data for EWR's direct connections is drawn from comprehensive flight aggregators such as flightsfrom.com 9 and directflights.com.3 These sources are supplemented by Google Flights information to confirm operational status and identify operating airlines.10Addressing Data Discrepancies for Oakland (OAK) and San Jose (SJC) to EWR:An important clarification is needed for two Californian cities:
Oakland (OAK) to EWR: Information from Google Flights regarding Oakland to New York services explicitly states, "Nonstop flights: None. There are no direct flights on this route".35 Despite Oakland (OAK) having direct service to Reno (RNO) in March 5, its lack of a direct connection to Newark (EWR) means it will be excluded from the final list of cities offering dual direct access.
San Jose (SJC) to EWR: A data contradiction was observed. While a general Google Flights search for San Jose to New York indicated "Nonstop flights: None" 36, United Airlines' official website clearly advertises and lists fares for "United flights from San Jose to New York/Newark," specifically detailing SJC to EWR services.33 Furthermore, flightsfrom.com also includes San Jose (SJC) as a destination with non-stop flights from EWR.9 In such instances of conflicting information between third-party aggregators and direct airline data, the airline's own published information for its routes is generally prioritized due to its directness and currency. Flight aggregators, while comprehensive, may experience data lags or have search parameters that do not capture all available flights, especially those that are not daily. Therefore, for the purpose of this report, the direct San Jose (SJC) to Newark (EWR) service operated by United Airlines is considered operational.
The following U.S. cities, which have confirmed March direct flights to RNO, also have generally established direct flight services to EWR:
Atlanta (ATL): Typically served by Delta, United, Frontier, and American to EWR 10, with a general frequency of 13-20 flights per day to EWR.9
Austin (AUS): Typically served by United, Spirit, Delta, and American to EWR 11, with a general frequency of 6 flights per day to EWR.9
Chicago O'Hare (ORD): Typically served by United, American, Spirit, and Delta to EWR 3, with a general frequency of 18-21 flights per day to EWR.9
Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW): Typically served by American, United, Spirit, Frontier, and Delta to EWR 3, with a general frequency of 9-12 flights per day to EWR.9
Denver (DEN): Typically served by United, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest, and Frontier to EWR 3, with a general frequency of 8 flights per day to EWR.9
Houston-Intercontinental (IAH): Typically served by United, Spirit, JetBlue, and Delta to EWR 3, with a general frequency of 9-11 flights per day to EWR.9
Las Vegas (LAS): Typically served by United, Spirit, Delta, JetBlue, American, and Frontier to EWR 3, with a general frequency of 8-11 flights per day to EWR.9
Los Angeles (LAX): Typically served by United, JetBlue, Alaska, Spirit, Delta, American, and Frontier to EWR 3, with a general frequency of 15-17 flights per day to EWR.9
Minneapolis (MSP): Typically served by Delta, United, Sun Country, and American to EWR 28, with a general frequency of 6-8 flights per day to EWR.9
Phoenix (PHX): Typically served by United, American, Delta, and JetBlue to EWR 29, with a general frequency of 9 flights per day to EWR.9
Salt Lake City (SLC): Typically served by Delta, United, and JetBlue to EWR 30, with a general frequency of 4-5 flights per day to EWR.9
San Diego (SAN): Typically served by United, Alaska, Delta, and JetBlue to EWR 31, with a general frequency of 4-5 flights per day to EWR.9
San Francisco (SFO): Typically served by United, Alaska, Delta, JetBlue, and American to EWR 3, with a general frequency of 13-14 flights per day to EWR.9
San Jose (SJC): Served by United to EWR.9 General daily frequency to EWR is not specified in 9 but the route is confirmed operational by United.
Seattle (SEA): Typically served by Alaska, United, Delta, and JetBlue to EWR 34, with a general frequency of 3-5 flights per day to EWR.9
V. Cities with Direct Flights to Both Newark (EWR) and Reno (RNO) in MarchThis section presents the consolidated findings, listing the U.S. cities that offer direct, non-stop flights to both Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) and Reno-Tahoe International Airport (RNO) during the month of March. The data for RNO reflects specific March 2025 schedules 5, while EWR data is based on generally operational routes with frequencies indicated by sources such as flightsfrom.com.9The presence of a city on this list indicates a significant level of air service, often characteristic of major airline hubs or substantial origin-destination markets with demand supporting connections to both a primary East Coast gateway and a key Western U.S. airport. Many of these common cities, such as Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Atlanta, and Houston, are indeed major airline hubs or large metropolitan areas. Las Vegas also features prominently, underscoring its role as a major leisure destination with broad national connectivity. The persistence of RNO routes from these hubs and key cities into March suggests either year-round demand or demand significant enough to warrant service during the early spring shoulder season.For some routes, particularly to RNO in March, service may be dominated by one or two carriers (e.g., only United from Houston-IAH to RNO, only Delta from Atlanta to RNO 5). This can impact airline choice and potentially pricing for that specific leg of the journey. Travelers should note that while they might have multiple airline options for flights to EWR from these cities, their choices for a direct RNO flight in March could be more restricted.The following table summarizes these cities and their respective services:Table: Confirmed U.S. Cities with Direct Flights to Both EWR & RNO in March

The competitive environment in these origin cities, particularly major hubs like Denver, Los Angeles, and Chicago, often results in more flight options and potentially more competitive pricing for travelers, at least for the EWR leg. The RNO March schedule 5 also indicates multiple carriers from hubs like Denver and Las Vegas to Reno, suggesting a degree of competition on these routes as well.Furthermore, the RNO March schedule 5 reveals that "daily" service is not always seven days a week. For instance, service from Houston (IAH) to RNO is on Saturdays only, and from Dallas-Love Field (DAL) to RNO only on specific Saturdays in March. Service from Austin (AUS) to RNO is on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays, while from San Jose (SJC) to RNO it's on Sundays, Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. This variability underscores that March demand from certain origins may not sustain full daily operations, leading airlines to optimize for peak travel days. Travelers must, therefore, meticulously check the exact days of operation for RNO flights from these cities.VI. Important Considerations for March Flight PlanningWhen planning travel for March that involves direct flights to both Newark (EWR) and Reno (RNO), several critical factors must be taken into account to ensure a smooth and well-informed booking process.Data Currency and Imperative of Schedule Verification:Airline schedules are inherently fluid and subject to change with little notice. Operational requirements, shifts in passenger demand, aircraft availability, and broader industry or global events can all impact flight timings and availability. One source explicitly states, "Flights are subject to change at the discretion of the air carrier".13 This is particularly true when planning for a specific future month like March. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that travelers verify all flight details—including availability on their specific dates of travel, departure and arrival times, the operating airline, and current pricing—directly with the airlines themselves or through reputable, real-time flight booking platforms. Tools like Google Flights offer features to explore dates and filter searches, which can aid in this verification process.43 This final check should be performed much closer to the intended travel dates.March as a Transitional Travel Month:March often serves as a transitional period in the travel industry. It bridges the end of the winter season with the onset of spring, leading to potential shifts in travel demand and corresponding airline schedule adjustments. The official Reno (RNO) March flight schedule provides clear examples of this dynamism, with some services commencing during the month (e.g., Southwest from Austin to RNO on March 6th; Frontier from Denver and Las Vegas to RNO on March 7th) and others ceasing operations (e.g., Spirit from Los Angeles to RNO on March 3rd).5 This volatility means that assumptions about service continuity throughout the entire month of March can be unreliable without direct and timely verification.Critical Impact of "Day of Week" Variations on Availability:A detailed review of the flight schedules, especially for Reno (RNO) in March, reveals significant variations in flight frequency depending on the day of the week.5 For example, United Airlines' direct service from Houston-Intercontinental (IAH) to RNO is scheduled for Saturdays only in March. Similarly, Southwest Airlines' service from Dallas-Love Field (DAL) to RNO is available only on specific Saturdays during the month (March 8th, 15th, 22nd, 29th). Other routes, like Southwest from Austin (AUS) to RNO, operate on select weekdays (Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays).5 This pattern indicates that a traveler's flexibility with their specific travel dates will heavily influence their ability to secure direct flights, particularly to RNO.Connecting Flights as a Readily Available Alternative:While this report has focused exclusively on direct, non-stop flight services as per the user's request, it is important to acknowledge that connecting flights offer a widely available alternative. If direct flights from a preferred origin city are not available on the desired dates or times, or if they are prohibitively expensive for March travel, services involving one or more stops through various U.S. airline hubs will almost certainly be an option to reach both Newark (EWR) and Reno (RNO).The process of obtaining specific flight information for a future month like March underscores the strategic value of consulting official airport-released schedules when available. The Reno-Tahoe International Airport's March flight schedule 5 proved to be the most granular and reliable source for RNO's connectivity, containing details on service start/end dates and day-specific frequencies that are not always captured with the same level of precision or timeliness by general third-party flight aggregators. Airport authorities often have the most current overview of services planned for their facilities due to their direct coordination with airlines. This reinforces the recommendation for users to perform final verification using primary sources (airlines or official airport information) and highlights a best practice in travel data analysis: prioritizing official, time-specific sources when the query demands such precision.VII. Concluding RemarksThe analysis has identified fifteen U.S. cities offering direct flight connectivity to both Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) and Reno-Tahoe International Airport (RNO) for the month of March. These cities are Atlanta (ATL), Austin (AUS), Chicago O'Hare (ORD), Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Denver (DEN), Houston-Intercontinental (IAH), Las Vegas (LAS), Los Angeles (LAX), Minneapolis (MSP), Phoenix (PHX), Salt Lake City (SLC), San Diego (SAN), San Francisco (SFO), San Jose (SJC), and Seattle (SEA). The service to Reno (RNO) from these origins in March is based on specific airport schedule data for March 2025 5, while connectivity to Newark (EWR) is based on generally operational routes.This list provides a robust starting point for travelers seeking this particular dual-airport access. However, the dynamic nature of airline scheduling cannot be overstated. Flight availability, timings, operating carriers, and frequencies, especially for a future month, are subject to change. The March schedule for Reno, for instance, shows services starting or ending within the month and significant day-of-week variations for several routes.5 The service from Minneapolis to Reno is exceptionally limited to a single specified flight date in March.Therefore, the final and most critical step for any traveler is to verify all flight details directly with the airlines or through reliable, real-time flight booking platforms much closer to their intended March travel dates. This due diligence will ensure that travel plans are based on the most current and accurate information available, mitigating potential disruptions. This report serves as a comprehensive initial guide, but final confirmation remains the traveler's responsibility.
